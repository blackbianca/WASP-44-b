\title{Detection of a transiting Hot Jupiter around WASP-44}

\begin{abstract}

\emph{In the following report we work on WASP-44 b, an exoplanet orbiting 
arounf its G-type mother star, located in the constellation of Cetus. 
We first take a look at its atmospheric parameters and derive mass and 
radius (\cite{Morton}). Then, we correct for limb darkening effect in different ways 
(\cite{claret2011}, \cite{claret2017}, \cite{claret2018}). We also take 
some images taken by Copernico at the Asiago Observatory into consideration 
and, after proper correction, we use them to extract the light curve of 
the alleged planet.}

\section{Introduction}

Confirmed exoplanets are growing in number year by year, and transit method 
is nowadays a widely spread method. Most planets nowadays are discovered 
by tracing the lightcurve and searching for any sign of a weakening in the 
flux.

In this report we focus on WASP-44 b, a Jupyter-size planet orbiting around 
a G-type star, located in the constellation of Cetus.
Among the numerous available reports on the planet, we decided to make a 
conservative choice and avoid any result which is not inferred via 
spectroscopy. This leads us to rule out several papers about the object, and 
only work with the discovery paper (\cite{Anderson}). In this paper, estimates 
of the atmospheric parameters of WASP-44 are provided via an analysis of 
the width of spectral lines.

\section{Data analysis}

\subsection{Inferring mass and radius}

The $H_{\alpha}$ line was used to determine the effective temperature (Teff ),
while the $NaI$ D and $MgI$ b lines were used as surface gravity
($\log{g^*}$) diagnostics (\cite{Anderson}). The elemental abundances, including $[Fe/H]$ 
were determined from equivalent width measurements of several clean and 
unblended lines. This led to proper estimation of the atmospheric parameter 
triplet $T_{eff}$, $\log{g^*}$ and $[Fe/H]$. Quoted errors include statistical 
uncertainties only. In the same conservative spirit we 
previously showed, we add in quadrature a further term to the errors of 
all three parameters (\cite{Sousa}). We're in fact more interested in an 
accurate result rather than a precise one.
This leads to the following results 
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    $T_{eff}$ (K) & $\log{g^*}$ & $[Fe/H]$ \\
    $5400 \pm 162$ & $4.5 \pm 0.2$ & $0.06 \pm 0.11$ \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}


\subsection{Limb darkening correction}

Limb darkening is an important effect when observing a star, 
everything but negligible. In short, the edges of the luminosity profile 
of a star always look darker: this is because there is a physical, constant 
distance $L$ at which optical depth is equal to unity, further than which 
we cannot observe (photons do not reach us). This characteristic size, 
however, can go deep inside the hot layers of the star if we look straight 
to the center, being $L$ radial, while it can stop at colder, outer layers 
if we look at the edges of the star, since $L$ and our LOS are not radial 
anymore.

\end{figure}
Correcting for this effect may be challenging. In fact we can measure it 
directly only for the Sun, while we need to model it somehow for any other 
star, meaning figure out a proper law for the intensity decrease $I(\mu)$, 
where $\mu = \sqrt{1-r^2}$. Many choices are plausible at this point: a 
uniform behaviour, a linear, a quadratic, a square-root or a 
logarithmic law are all valid guesses. Parametrizing such laws introduces 
the so-called \textit{LD-coefficients}, which will depend on the stellar 
parameters. Knowing the latter relationship (for instance calibrating it 
based on a large sample of stars) allows to obtain the coefficients directly 
from the atmopsheric parameters. 
The alternative way is fitting the light curve leaving the coefficients free.

The choice of the functional dependence on $\mu$ is a delicate one. Multiple 
approaches can be followed, basing on different papers. 

\subsubsection{Claret 2017}
We can represent data tables in \cite{claret2017} as 2D histograms, 
where first we fix metallicity, then gravity and see how the LD coefficients 
$c_1$ and $c_2$ depend on all three atmospheric parameters.
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.25, angle=0]{../pictures/Claret2017/2017_c1_fixedmet}

    \caption{LD coefficient with fixed metallicty, fixed gravity}
\end{figure}
Furthermore, it's very interesting to check the strength of the dependance 
on each atmospheric parameters. Turns out LD coefficients are essentially a 
function of temperature, and minor dependences on gravity and metallicity 
can be barely appreciated.
