# WASP-44-b
Astrophysics Laboratory 2: project for WASP-44 b

CHAPTER 1
We used PARAM software web interface to infer mass and radius of the star. For PARAM input, we considered NASA Exoplanet Archive suggested papers, ruling out any atmospheric parameter of non-spectroscopic origin.

CHAPTER 2
We corrected Copernico images by using bias and flat field. Then we focused on the target and found a suitable reference star within the FoV.
