    "A **contaminant** is a star, different from your target, which light is entering in your photometric aperture (i.e. the mask), causing a dilution of the transit. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta m$ is the magnitude difference between the contaminant and your target, in the Gaia G band \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the TFP plot to identify possible contaminants entering in your default mask. \n",
    "- If the contaminant is within the mask, but it $\\Delta m > 4$ (the contaminant is fainter than the target of 4 magnitude in G band), you can ignore it \n",
    "- if $2 < \\Delta m < 4$ (with the contaminant _fainter_ than your target), but the contaminant is at leat 2 pixels away, for now you can ignore the contaminant. Later on you will need to compare the transit depth with the value in literature and with the TASTE light curve, check if they are consistent, and decide if you want to repeat the light curve extraction including the contaminant\n",
    "- if $\\Delta m < 2$ you should include the contaminant in the mask\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the _Gaia ID_ of the contaminat, run again tpfplotter with the additional flag `--SAVEGAIA`\n",

    "Now that we have the TIC number of the contaminant from the ExoFOP page, you may want to know the TESS default aperture for the contaminant and avoid the daunting task or choosing the mask by yourself. \n",

    "- download the TPD plot of the contaminant using tpfplotter\n",
    "- update the mask of your target by adding the pixels of the contaminant \n",
